       "'SWAMI VIVEKANANDA’S  SPEECH AT\\nWORLD PARLIAMENT OF RELIGION, CHICAGO\\nRESPONSE TO WELCOME\\nSisters and Brothers of America,\\n      It fills my heart with joy unspeakable to rise in respons e to the warm and cordial welcome\\nwhich you have given us. I thank you in the name of the most ancient order of monks in the\\nworld; I thank you in the name of the mother  of religions; and I thank you in the name of\\nmillions and millions of Hindu people of all classes and sects. My thanks, also, to some of the\\nspeakers on this platform who, referring to the delegates from the Orient, have told you that\\nthese men from far-off nations may well claim the honour of bearing to different lands the\\nidea of toleration. I am proud to belong to a religion which has taught the world both\\ntolerance and universal acceptance. We believe not only in universal toleration, but we accept\\nall religions as true. I am proud to belong to a nation which has shelte red the persecuted and\\nthe refugees of all religions a nd all nations of the earth. I am  proud to tell you that we have\\ngathered in our bosom the purest remnant of th e Israelites, who came to Southern India and\\ntook refuge with us in the very year in whic h their holy temple was shattered to pieces by\\nRoman tyranny.  I  am  proud  to  belong to th e  religion  which  ha s  sheltered  and  is\\nstill  fostering remnant Zoroastrian nation. I will quote to you, brethren, a few lines from a\\nhymn which I remember to have repeated from my earliest boyhood, which is every day\\nrepeated by millions of human beings: \"As th e different streams having their sources in\\ndifferent places all mingle their water in th e sea, so, O Lord, the different paths which\\nmen take through different tendencies, various  though they appear, cr ooked or straight, all\\nlead to Thee.\"\\n      The present convention, which is one of the most august assemblies ever held, is in itself\\na vindication, a declaration to the world of th e wonderful doctrine pr eached in the Gita:\\n\"Whosoever comes to Me, through whatsoever form, I reach him; all men are struggling\\nthrough paths which  in the end lead to me .\" Sectarianism, bigotry, and its horrible\\ndescendant, fanaticism, have long possessed this  beautiful earth. They have filled the earth\\nwith violence, drenched it ofte n and often with  human blood, destroyed civilisation and sent\\nwhole nations to despair. Had  it not been for these horrible demons, human society would be\\nfar more advanced than it is now. But their tim e is come; and I fervently hope that  the bell\\nthat tolled this morning in honour of this conve ntion may be the death-knell of all fanaticism,\\nof all persecutions with the swor d or with   the pen, and of all uncharitable feelings between\\npersons wending their  way to the same goal.\\nWhy We Disagree\\n      15 Sep 1893\\n      I will tell you a little story. You have heard the eloquent speaker who has just finished\\nsay, \"Let us cease from abusing each other,\" and he was very sorry that there should be\\nalways so much variance.\\n      But I  think  I should tell you a story wh ich would illustrate the cau se of this variance. A\\nfrog lived in a well. It had lived there for a long  time. It was born there and brought up there,\\nand yet was a little, small frog. Of course the evolutionists were not there then to tell uswhether the frog lost its eyes or not, but, for ou r story\\'s sake, we must take it for granted that\\nit had its eyes, and that it ever y day cleansed the water of all the worms and bacilli that lived\\nin it with an energy that would do credit to our modern bacteriologists. In this way it went on\\nand became a little sleek and fat. Well, one da y another frog that live d in the sea came and\\nfell into the well.\\n      \"Where are you from?\"\\n      \"I am from the sea.\"      \"The sea! How big is that? Is  it as big as my well?\" and he took a leap\\n      from one side of the well to the other.      \"My friend,\" said the frog of the sea, \"how do you compare the sea with\\n      your little well?\"      Then the frog took another leap and asked, \"Is your sea so big?\"\\n      \"What nonsense you speak, to compare the sea with your well!\"      \"Well, then,\" said the frog of the well, \"nothing can be bigger than my      well; there can be nothing bigger  than this; this fellow is a liar, so\\n      turn him out.\"\\n      That has been the difficulty all the while.      I am a Hindu. I am sitting in my own little  well and thinking that  the whole world is my\\nlittle well. The Christian sits in his little well and thinks the whole world is his well. The\\nMohammedan sits in his little well and thinks that is the whole world.  I have to thank you of\\nAmerica for the great attempt you are making to break down the barriers of this little\\nworld of ours, and hope that, in the futu re, the Lord will help you to accomplish your\\npurpose.\\nPaper on Hinduism\\n      Read at the Parliament on 19th September, 1893\\n      Three religions now stand in the world which have come down to us from time\\nprehistoric--Hinduism, Zoroastrianism and J udaism. They have all received tremendous\\nshocks and all of them prove by their survival their internal  strength. But while Judaism\\nfailed to absorb Christianity and was driven out of its place of bi rth by its all-conquering\\ndaughter, and a handful of Pars ees is all that remains to tell the tale of their grand\\nreligion, sect after sect arose in India and seemed to shake the religion of the Vedas to its\\nvery foundations, but like the waters of the seashore in a tremendous earthquake it receded\\nonly for a while, only to return in an all- absorbing flood, a thousand times more vigorous,\\nand when the tumult of the rush was over, th ese sects were all sucked in, absorbed, and\\nassimilated into the immense body of the mother faith. From the high spiritual flights of the\\nVedanta philosophy, of which the latest discoveri es of science seem lik e echoes, to the low\\nideas of  idolatry with its multifarious mythology, the agnostici sm of the Buddhists, and the\\natheism of the Jains, each and all have a place in the Hindu\\'s religion. Where then, the\\nquestion arises, where is the common centre to  which all these widely diverging radii\\nconverge? Where is the common basis upon which all these seemingly hopeless\\ncontradictions rest?  And this is th e question I shall attempt to answer.\\n      The Hindus have received their religion through revelation, the Vedas. They hold that the\\nVedas are without beginning and wi thout end. It may  sound ludicr ous to this audience, how abook can be without beginning or  end. But by the Vedas no books are meant. They mean the\\naccumulated  treasury of spiritual laws discovere d by different persons in different times. Just\\nas the law of gravitation existed before its disc overy, and would exist if all humanity forgot it,\\nso is it with the laws that govern the spiritua l world. The moral, ethical , and spiritual relations\\nbetween soul and soul and between  individual spirits and the Fath er of all spirits, were there\\nbefore their discovery, and would remain even if we forgot them.\\n      The discoverers of these laws are call ed Rishis, and we honour th em as perfected beings.\\nI am glad to tell this audience that some of  the very greatest of them were women. Here it\\nmay be said that these laws as laws may be without end, but they must have had a beginning.\\nThe Vedas teach us  that creation is without be ginning or end. Science is said to have proved\\nthat the sum total of cosmic energy is alwa ys the same. Then, if there was a time when\\nnothing existed, where was all this manifested energy? Some say it was in a potential form inGod. In that case God is sometimes potential and sometimes kinetic, which would make Him\\nmutable. Everything mutable is a com pound, and everything compound must undergo that\\nchange which is called destruction. So God woul d die, which is absur d. Therefore there never\\nwas a time when there was no creation.\\n      If I may be allowed to use a simile, creation and creator are tw o lines, without beginning\\nand without end, running parallel to  each other. God is the ev er active providence, by whose\\npower systems after systems are being evolved out of chaos, made to run for a time and again\\ndestroyed. This is what the Brahmin boy repeat s every day: \"The sun and the moon, the Lord\\ncreated like the suns and moons of previous cy cles.\" And this agrees with modern science.\\n      Here I stand and if I shut my eyes, and try to conceive my existence, \"I\",  \"I\", \"I\", what is\\nthe idea before me? The idea of a body. Am I, then,  nothing but a combination of material\\nsubstances? The Vedas declare, \"No\". I am a spirit living in a body. I am not the body. The\\nbody will die, but  I shall not die. Here am I in this body; it will fall, but I shall go on\\nliving. I had also a past. The soul was not created, for creation means a combination which\\nmeans a certain future dissolution. If then the soul was created, it must die. Some are born\\nhappy, enjoy perfect health, with beautiful body, mental vigour and all wants supplied.\\nOthers are born miserable, some are without hands or feet, others again are idiots and\\nonly drag on a wretched existen ce. Why, if they are all create d, why does a just and merciful\\nGod create one happy and another unhappy, why is  He so partial? Nor would it mend matters\\nin the least to hold that those who are miserabl e in this life will be happy in a future one. Why\\nshould a man be miserable even here in the rei gn of a just and merciful  God?  In the second\\nplace, the idea of a creator G od does not explain the anomaly, but simply expresses the cruel\\nfiat of an all-powerful being. There must have been causes, then, before his birth, to make a\\nman miserable or happy and t hose were his past actions.\\n      Are not all the tendencies of the mi nd and the body accounted for by inherited aptitude?\\nHere are two parallel lines of ex istence--one of the mind, the othe r of matter. If matter and its\\ntransformations answer for all that we have, there is no necessity fo r supposing the existence\\nof a soul. But it cannot be proved that thought has been evolved out of matter, and if a\\nphilosophical monism is inevitable, spiritual m onism is certainly logical and no less desirable\\nthan a materialistic monism; but neither of these is necessary here.\\n      We cannot deny that bodi es acquire certain tendencies from  heredity, but those tendencies\\nonly mean the physical configuration, through which a peculiar mind alone can act in a\\npeculiar way. There are other tendencies peculiar  to a soul caused by its past actions. And asoul with a certain tendency w ould by the laws of affinity ta ke birth in a body which is the\\nfittest instrument for the display of that tende ncy. This is in accord with science wants to\\nexplain everything by habit, and habit is got through repetitions. So re petitions are necessary\\nto explain the natural habits of a new-born s oul. And since they were  not obtained in this\\npresent life, they must have  come down from past lives.\\n      There is another suggestion. Taking all these for granted, now is it that I do not remember\\nanything of my past life? This  can be easily explained I am now speaking English. It is not\\nmy mother tongue, in fact no words of my mother tongue are now present in my\\nconsciousness; mut let me try to bring th em up, and they rush in. That shows that\\nconsciousness is only the surface of the mental ocean, and within its de pths are stored up all\\nour experiences. Try and struggle, they w ould come up and you would by conscious even of\\nyour past life.\\n      This is direct and demonstrative eviden ce. Verification is the pe rfect proof of a theory,\\nand here is the challenge thrown to the world by the Rishis. We have discovered the secret by\\nwhich the very depths of the ocean of memo ry can be stirred up-try it and you would get a\\ncomplete  reminiscence of your past life.\\n      So then the Hindu belives that he is a spirit. Him the sword cannot pierce-him the fire\\ncannot burn-him the water cannot melt-him the air cannot dry. The Hindu belives that every\\nsoul is a circle whose  circumference is now here, but whose centre is located in the body, and\\nthat death means the change of this centre from body to body. Not is the soul bound by the\\nconditions of matter. In its very essence it  is free. unbounded. holy, pure, and perfect. But\\nsomehow of other it finds itself tied down to matter and thinks of itself as matter.\\n      Why should the free, perfect, and pure be ing be thus under the thra ldom of matter, is the\\nnext question. How can the perfect soul be del uded into the belief th at it is imperfect? We\\nhave been told that the Hindus  shirk the question and say that  no such question can be there.\\nSome thinkers want to answer  it by positing one or more quasi -perfect beings, and use big\\nscientific names to fill up the gap. But nami ng is not explaining. The question remains the\\nsame. How can the perfect become the quasi-per fect; how can the pure, the absolute, change\\neven a microscopic particle of its nature? But the Hindu is sincere. He does not want to take\\nshelter under sophistry. He is brave enough to face the question in a manly fashion; an the\\nquestion and say that no such question can be there. Some thinkers want to answer it by\\npositing one or more quasi-perfect beings, and use big scientific names to fill up the gap. Butnaming is not explaining. The question remains the same. How can the perfect become the\\nquasi-perfect; how can the pure, the absolute, change even a microscopic particle of its\\nnature? But the Hindu is sincere. He does not want to take shelter under sophistry. He is\\nbrave enough to face the question in a manly fash ion; anmmortal, perfect and infinite, and\\ndeath means only a change of centre  from one body to another. The present is determined by\\nour past actions, and the future by the pr esent. The soul will go on evolving up or\\nreverting back from birth to birth and death to  death. But here is another question: Is man a\\ntiny boat in a tempest, raised one moment on the foamy crest of a billow and dashed down\\ninto a yawning chasm the next , rolling to and fro at the mercy of good and bad actions--a\\npowerless, helpless wreck in an ever-raging, ev er-rushing, uncompromising current of cause\\nand effect; a little moth placed under th e wheel of causation which rolls on crushing\\neverything in its way and waits not for the widow\\'s tears or th e orphan\\'s cry? The heart sinks\\nat the idea, yet this is the law of Nature.  Is there no hope? Is ther e no escape?--was the cry\\nthat went up from the  bottom of  the heart of despair. It re ached the throne of mercy, andwords of hope and consolation came down and in spired a Vedic sage, and he stood up before\\nthe world and in trumpet voice proclaimed the gl ad tidings:  \"Hear, ye  children of immortal\\nbliss! even ye that reside in  higher  spheres! I have found the Ancient One who is beyond all\\ndarkness, all  delusion: knowing Him alone you shall be saved from death over again.\"\\n\"Children of immortal bliss\"  --what a sweet, what a hopeful name! Allow me to call you,\\nbrethren, by that sweet name--heirs of immo rtal bliss--yea, the Hindu refuses to call you\\nsinners. Ye are the Children of God, the sharers of immortal bliss, holy and perfect beings.\\nYe divinities on earth--sinners! It is a sin to call a man so; it is a standing libel on human\\nnature. Come up, O lions, and shake off the delusion that you are sheep; you are souls\\nimmortal, spirits free, blest a nd eternal; ye are not matter, ye are not bodies; matter is your\\nservant, not you the servant of matter. Thus it  is that the Vedas proclaim not a dreadful\\ncombination of  unforgiving laws, not an endle ss prison of cause and e ffect, but that at the\\nhead of all these laws, in a nd through every particle of matte r and force, stands One \"by\\nwhose command the wind blows, the fire burn s, the clouds rain, a nd death stalks upon the\\nearth.\"\\n      And what is His nature?  He is ever ywhere, the pure and formless One, the Almighty and\\nthe All-merciful. \"Thou art our father, Thou art our mother, Thou art our beloved friend,\\nThou art the source of all strength; give us st rength. Thou art He that  beareth the burdens of\\nthe universe; help me bear the little burden of this life.\" Thus sang the Rishis of the Vedas.\\nAnd how to worship Him? Through love. \"He is to be worshipped as the one beloved,\\ndearer than everything in this and the next life.\"\\n      This is the doctrine of love declared in  the Vedas, and let us see how it is fully developed\\nand taught by Krishna, whom the Hindus believe to have been God incarnate on earth.\\n      He taught that a man ought to live in this world like a lo tus leaf, which grows in water but\\nis never moistened by water; so a man ought to live in the world--his heart to God and his\\nhands to work.\\n      It is good to love God for hope of reward in this or the next worl d, but it is better to love\\nGod for love\\'s sake, and the prayer goes: \"Lord, I do not want w ealth, nor children, nor\\nlearning. If it be Thy will, I shall go from birt h to birth, but grant me this, that I may love\\nThee without the hope of reward--love unselfishly  for love\\'s sake.\" One of the disciples of\\nKrishna, the then Emperor of India, was driv en from his kingdom by his enemies and had to\\ntake shelter with his queen in a forest in th e Himalayas, and there one day the queen asked\\nhim how it was that he, the most virtuous of men, should suffer so much misery.\\nYudhishthira answered, \"Behol d, my queen, the Himalayas, how grand and beautiful they\\nare; I love them. They do not give me anythi ng, but my nature is to love the grand, the\\nbeautiful, therefore I love them. Similarly, I love the Lord. He is the source of all beauty, of\\nall sublimity. He is the only object to be loved; my  nature is to love Him, and therefore I love.\\nI do not pray for anything; I do not ask for an ything. Let Him place me wh erever He likes. I\\nmust love Him for love\\'s sake. I cannot trade love.\"\\n      The Vedas teach that the soul is divi ne, only held in the bondage of matter; perfection\\nwill be reached when this bond will burst, and the word they use for it is therefore, Mukti--\\nfreedom, freedom from the bonds of imperf ection, freedom from death and misery.\\n      And this bondage can only fall off th rough the mercy of God, and this mercy comes on\\nthe pure. So purity is the condition of His mercy. How does that mercy act? He revealsHimself to the pure heart; the pure and the stainless see God, yea, even in this life; then and\\nthen only all the crookedness of th e heart is made straight. Th en all doubt ceases. He is no\\nmore the freak of a terrible la w of causation. This is the very centre, the very vital conception\\nof Hinduism. The Hindu does not  want to live upon words a nd theories. If there are\\nexistences beyond the ordinary sensuous existence,  he wants to come face to face with them.\\nIf there is a soul in him which is not matter, if  there is an all-merciful  universal Soul, he will\\ngo to Him direct. He must see Him, and that al one can destroy all doubts. So the best proof a\\nHindu sage gives about the soul, about God, is: \"I have seen th e soul; I have seen God.\" And\\nthat is the only condition of perfection. The Hindu religion does not consist in struggles and\\nattempts to believe a certain doctrine or dogma, but  in realising--not in believing, but in being\\nand becoming.\\n      Thus the whole object of their system  is by constant struggle to become perfect, to\\nbecome divine, to reach God and see God, and this reaching God, seeing God, becoming\\nperfect even as the Father in  Heaven is perfect, constitu tes the religion of the Hindus.\\n      And what becomes of a man when he atta ins perfection? He lives a life of bliss infinite.\\nHe enjoys infinite and perfect bliss, having obtained the only thi ng in which man ought to\\nhave pleasure, namely God, and enjoys the bliss with God.\\n      So far all the Hindus are agreed. This is  the common religion of all the sects of India; but,\\nthen, perfection is absolute, a nd the absolute cannot be two or  three. It cannot have any\\nqualities. It cannot be an individual. And so when a soul becomes perfect and absolute, it\\nmust become one with Brahman, and it would only realise the Lord as the perfection, the\\nreality, of its own nature and existence, the existence absolu te, knowledge absolute, and bliss\\nabsolute. We have often and often read this called the losing of individuality and becoming a\\nstock or a stone. \"He jests at  scars that never felt a wound.\"\\n      I tell you it is nothing of the kind. If it is happiness to enjoy the consciousness of this\\nsmall body, it must be greater happiness to enjoy the consciousne ss of two bodies, the\\nmeasure of happiness increasing with the consciousness of an  increasing number of bodies,\\nthe aim, the ultimate of happiness being reached when it would become a universal\\nconsciousness.\\n      Therefore, to gain this infinite univ ersal individuality, this miserable little prison-\\nindividuality must go. Then alone can death ceas e when I am one with life, then alone can\\nmisery cease when I am one with happiness itse lf, then alone can all errors cease when I am\\none with knowledge itself; and this is the necessary scientific conclusion. Science has\\nproved to me that physical individuality is a delusion, that really  my body is one little\\ncontinuously changing body in an unbroken ocean of matter; and Advaita (unity) is the\\nnecessary conclusion with my other counterpart, soul.\\n      Science is nothing but the finding of un ity. As soon as science w ould reach perfect unity,\\nit would stop from further progress, because it would reach the goal. Thus Chemistry could\\nnot progress farther when it would discover one element out of which all others could be\\nmade. Physics would stop when it would be ab le to fulfil its services in discovering one\\nenergy of which all the others are but manife stations, and the scien ce of religion becomes\\nperfect when it would discover Hi m who is the one life in a universe of death, Him who is the\\nconstant basis of an ever-cha nging world. One who is the only Soul of which all souls are butdelusive manifestations. Thus is it, through mu ltiplicity and duality, that  the ultimate unity is\\nreached. Religion can go no farther. This is the goal of all science.\\n      All science is bound to come to this  conclusion in the long run. Manifestation, and not\\ncreation, is the word of scien ce today, and the Hindu is only glad that what he has been\\ncherishing in his bosom for ages is going to be taught in more forc ible language, and with\\nfurther light from the latest conclusions of science.\\n      Descend we now from the aspirations of  philosophy to the religion of the ignorant. At the\\nvery outset, I may tell you that there is no polytheism in India. In every temple, if one stands\\nby and listens, one will find the worshippers ap plying all the attributes of God, including\\nomnipresence, to the images. It is not polyt heism, nor would the name henotheism explain\\nthe situation. \"The rose called by any othe r name would smell as sweet.\" Names are not\\nexplanations.\\n      I remember, as a boy, hearing a Christ ian missionary preach to a crowd in India. Among\\nother sweet things he was telling them was that if  he gave a  blow to their idol with his stick,\\nwhat could it do? One of his hearers sharpl y answered, \"If I abuse your God, what can He\\ndo?\" \"You would be punished,\" sa id the preacher, \"when you die.\" \"So my idol will punish\\nyou when you die,\" retorted the Hindu.\\n      The tree is known by its fruits. When I have seen amongst them that are called idolaters,\\nmen, the like of whom in morality and spiritua lity and love I have never seen anywhere, I\\nstop and ask myself, \"Can sin beget holiness?\"\\n      Superstition is a great enemy of man, but bigotry is worse. Why does a Christian go to\\nchurch? Why is the cross holy? Why is the f ace turned toward the s ky in prayer? Why are\\nthere so many images in the Catholic Church? Why are there so many images in the minds of\\nProtestants when they pray? My brethren, we  can no more think a bout anything without a\\nmental image than we can live without breat hing. By the law of association, the material\\nimage calls up the mental idea and vice versa. Th is is why the Hindu uses an external symbol\\nwhen he worships. He will tell you, it helps to  keep his mind fixed on the Being to whom he\\nprays. He knows as well as you do that the imag e is not God, is not om nipresent. After all,\\nhow much does omnipresence mean to almost the whole world? It stands merely as aword, a symbol. Has God superficial area ? If not, when we repeat that word\\n\"omnipresent\", we think of the extended sky or of  space, that is all.  As we find that somehow\\nor other, by the laws of our mental constituti on, we have to associate our ideas of infinity\\nwith the image of the blue sky, or of the sea, so we natura lly connect our idea of holiness\\nwith the image of a church, a mosque, or a cr oss. The Hindus have associated the idea of\\nholiness, purity, truth, omnipresence, and such other ideas with different images and forms.\\nBut with this difference that while some peopl e devote their whole lives  to their idol of a\\nchurch and never rise higher, because with them religion means an intellectual assent to\\ncertain doctrines and doing good to their fello ws, the whole religion of the Hindu is centred\\nin realisation. Man is to become divine by real ising the divine. Idols or temples or churches\\nor books are only the supports, the helps, of  his spiritual childhood:  but on and on he must\\nprogress.\\n      He must not stop anywhere. \"External wo rship, material worship,\" say the scriptures, \"is\\nthe lowest stage; struggling to ri se high, mental prayer is the ne xt stage, but the highest stage\\nis when the Lord has been  realised.\" Mark, the same earnest man who is kneeling before theidol tells you,\"Him the sun cannot  express, nor the moon, nor th e stars, the lightning cannot\\nexpress Him, nor what we speak of as fire; through Him they shine.\" But he does not abuse\\nany one\\'s idol or call its worship sin. He recognis es in it a necessary st age of life.\"The child is\\nfather of the man.\" Would it be right for an old man to say that childhood is a sin or youth a\\nsin?\\n      If a man can realise his divine nature wi th the help of an image,  would it be right to call\\nthat a sin? Nor even when he has passed that stage, should he  call it an error. To the Hindu,\\nman is not travelling from error to truth, but from truth to tr uth, from lower to higher truth.\\nTo him all the religions, from the lowest fetis hism to the highest absolutism, mean so many\\nattempts of the human soul to grasp and realise the Infinite, each determined by the\\nconditions of its birth and association, and each of   these marks a stage of progress; and every\\nsoul is a young eagle soaring higher and highe r, gathering more and more strength, till it\\nreaches the Glorious Sun.\\n      Unity in variety is the plan of na ture, and the Hindu has recognised it. Every other\\nreligion lays down certain fixed dogmas, and trie s to force society to adopt them. It places\\nbefore society only one coat which must  fit J ack and John and Henry, all alike. If it does not\\nfit John or Henry,  he must go without a coat  to cover his body. The Hindus have discovered\\nthat the absolute can only be realised, or t hought of, or stated, thr ough the relative, and the\\nimages, crosses, and crescents are simply so many symbols--so many pegs to hang the\\nspiritual ideas on. It is not that this help is necessary for ever y one, but those that do not need\\nit have no right to say that it is wrong. Nor is it compulsory in Hinduism. One thing I must\\ntell you. Idolatry in India does not mean anything horrible. It is not the mother of harlots. On\\nthe other hand, it is the attempt of undevelope d minds to grasp high spiritual truths. The\\nHindus have their faults, they sometimes have their exceptions; but mark  this, they are always\\nfor punishing their own bodies, and never for cut ting the throats of th eir neighbours. If the\\nHindu fanatic burns himself on the pyre, he never lights the fire  of Inquisition. And even this\\ncannot be laid at the door of hi s religion any more than the bur ning of witches can be laid at\\nthe door of Christianity.\\n      To the Hindu, then, the whole world of religions is only a travelling, a coming up, of\\ndifferent men and women, through various cond itions and circumstances, to the same goal.\\nEvery religion is only evolving a God out of the material ma n, and the same God is the\\ninspirer of all of them. Why, th en, are there so many contradic tions? They are only apparent,\\nsays the Hindu. The contradictions come from th e same truth adapting it self to the varying\\ncircumstances of different natures.\\n      It is the same light coming through glasse s of different colours. And these little variations\\nare necessary for purposes of adaptation. But in the heart of everything the same truth reigns.\\nThe Lord has declared to the Hindu in His inca rnation as Krishna,\"I am  in every religion as\\nthe  thread through a string of pearls. Wher ever thou seest extraordinary holiness and\\nextraordinary power raising and purifying human ity, know thou that I am there .\" And what\\nhas been the result? I challenge the world to find, throughout  the whole system of Sanskrit\\nphilosophy, any such expression as that the Hi ndu alone will be saved and not others. Says\\nVyasa, \"We find perfect men even beyond the pale  of our caste and creed. \" One thing more.\\nHow, then, can the Hindu, whose whole fabr ic of thought centres in God, believe in\\nBuddhism which is agnostic, or in  Jainism which  is atheistic?      The Buddhists or the Jains do not depe nd upon God; but the whole force of their religion\\nis directed to the grea t central truth in every religion,  to evolve a God out of man. They have\\nnot seen the Father, but they have seen the Son. And he that hath seen the Son hath seen the\\nFather also. This, brethren, is a short sketch of the religious ideas of the Hindus. The Hindu\\nmay have failed to carry out all his plans, but if  there is ever to be a universal religion, it must\\nbe one which will have no location in place or ti me; which will be infini te like the God it will\\npreach, and  whose sun will shine upon the followers  of Krishna and of Christ, on saints and\\nsinners alike; which will not be  Brahminic or Buddhistic, Christian or Mohammedan, but the\\nsum total of all these, and still have infinite  space for development; which in its catholicity\\nwill embrace in its infinite arms, and find a place for, every human being, from the lowest\\ngrovelling savage not far removed from the brut e, to the highest man towering by the virtues\\nof his head and heart almost above humanit y, making society stand in awe of him and doubt\\nhis human nature. It will be a religion which will  have no place for pers ecution or intolerance\\nin its polity, which will recogni se divinity in every man and woman, and whose whole scope,\\nwhose whole force, will be created in aiding hum anity to realise its own true, divine nature.\\n      Offer such a religion, and all the nati ons will follow you. Asoka\\'s council was a council of\\nthe Buddhist faith. Akbar\\'s, though more to th e purpose, was only a pa rlour-meeting. It was\\nreserved for America to proclaim to all quarters of the globe that the Lord is in every religion.\\nMay He who is the Brahman of the Hindus, the Ahura-Mazda of th e Zoroastrians, the\\nBuddha of the Buddhists, the Jehovah of the Jews , the Father in Heaven  of the Christians,\\ngive strength to you to carry out  your noble idea! The star aros e in the East; it travelled\\nsteadily towards the West, sometimes dimmed a nd sometimes effulgent, till it made a circuit\\nof  the world; and now it is again rising on the very horizon of  the East, the borders of the\\nSanpo, a thousandfold more effulgent than it ever was before.\\n      Hail, Columbia, motherland of liberty! It  has been given to thee , who never dipped her\\nhand in her neighbour\\'s blood, who never found out  that the shortest way of becoming rich\\nwas by robbing one\\'s neighbours, it has been given to thee to march at the vanguard of\\ncivilisation with the flag of harmony.\\nReligion not the crying need of India\\n      20th September, 1893\\n      Christians must always be ready for good criticism, and I hardly think that you will mind\\nif I make a little criticism. You Christians, who are so f ond of sending out missionaries to\\nsave the soul of the heathen--why do you not tr y to save their bodie s from starvation? In\\nIndia, during the terrible famines, thousa nds died from hunger, yet you Christians did\\nnothing. You erect churches all th rough India, but the crying evil in the East is not religion--\\nthey have religion enough--but it is bread that  the suffering millions of burning India cry out\\nfor with parched throats. They ask us for bread, but  we give them stones. It is an insult to a\\nstarving people to offer them religion; it is  an insult to a starving man to teach him\\nmetaphysics. In India a priest that preached for money would lose caste and be spat upon by\\nthe people. I came here to seek aid for my impoverished people, and I fully realised how\\ndifficult it was to get help for heathens  from Christians in a Christian land.Buddhism, the fulfillment of Hinduism\\n      26th September, 1893\\n      I am not a Buddhist, as  you have heard, and yet I am. If China, or Japan, or Ceylon follow\\nthe teachings of the Great Ma ster, India worships him as God incarnate on earth. You have\\njust now heard that I am goi ng to criticise Buddhism, but by that I wish you to understand\\nonly this. Far be it from me to criticise him whom I worship as God incarnate on earth. Butour views about Buddha are that he was not unde rstood properly by his di sciples. The relation\\nbetween Hinduism (by Hinduism, I mean the re ligion of the Vedas) and what is called\\nBuddhism at the present day is nearly the same as between J udaism and Christianity. Jesus\\nChrist was a Jew, and Shakya Muni was a Hindu. The Jews rejected Jesus Christ, nay,\\ncrucified him, and the Hindus have accepted Shakya Muni as God and worship him. But\\nthe real difference that we Hindus want to  show between modern Buddhism and what we\\nshould understand as the teachings of Lord B uddha lies principally in this: Shakya Muni\\ncame to preach nothing new. He al so, like Jesus, came to fulfil and not to destroy. Only, in\\nthe case of Jesus, it  was the old people, th e Jews, who did not understand him, while in the\\ncase of Buddha, it was his own fo llowers who did not realise the import of this teachings. As\\nthe Jew did not understand the fulfilment of the Old Testament, so the Buddhist did not\\nunderstand the fulfilment of the truths of th e Hindu religion. Again, I repeat, Shakya Muni\\ncame not to destroy, but he was the fulfilm ent, the logical conclusion, the logical\\ndevelopment of the religion of the Hindus.\\n      The religion of the Hindus is divided into  two parts: the ceremonial  and the spiritual. The\\nspiritual portion is specially st udied by the monks. In that there is no caste. A man from the\\nhighest caste and a man from the lowest may become a monk in India, and the two castes\\nbecome equal. In  religion there is no caste;  caste is simply a social institution. Shakya\\nMuni himself was a monk, and it wa s his glory that he had the la rge-heartedness to bring out\\nthe truths from the hidden Vedas and throw th em broadcast all over the world. He was the\\nfirst being in the world who brought missionarising into practi ce--nay, he was the first to\\nconceive the idea of proselytising.\\n      The great glory of the Master lay in  his wonderful sympathy fo r everybody, especially for\\nthe ignorant and the poor. Some  of his disciples were Brahmins. When Buddha was teaching,\\nSanskrit was no more the spoken  language in India. It was then only in the books of the\\nlearned. Some of  Buddha\\'s Brahmin disciple s wanted to translate his teachings into\\nSanskrit, but he distinct ly told them, \"I am for the poor, for the people;  let me speak in the\\ntongue of the people.\" And so to this day the great  bulk of his teachings are in  the vernacular\\nof that day in India. Whatever may be th e position of philosophy, whatever may be the\\nposition  of metaphysics, so long as there is su ch a thing as death in the world, so long as\\nthere is such a thing as weakness in the human heart, so long as  there is a cry going out of\\nthe heart of man in his very weakne ss, there shall be a faith in God.\\n      On the philosophic side the disciples of the Great Master dashed themselves against the\\neternal rocks of the Vedas and could not crus h  them, and on the other side they took away\\nfrom the nation that eternal God to which every one, man or woman, clings so fondly. And\\nthe result was  that Buddh ism had to die a natural death in India. At the present day there is\\nnot one who calls oneself a Buddhist in India, the land of its birth.\\n      But at the same time, Brahminism lo st something--that reforming zeal, that wonderful\\nsympathy and charity for ever ybody, that wonderful leaven which Buddhism had brought tothe masses and which had rendered Indian societ y so great that a Greek  historian who wrote\\nabout India of that time was led to say th at no Hindu was known to tell an untruth and no\\nHindu woman was known to be unchaste.\\n      Hinduism cannot live without B uddhism, nor Buddhism without Hinduism. Then\\nrealise what the separation has shown to us, that the Buddhists cannot stand without the brain\\nand philosophy of the Brahmins, nor the Brah min without the heart of the Buddhist. This\\nseparation between the Buddhists and the Brahmins is the cause  of the downfall of India.\\nThat is why India is populated by three hundred millions of beggars, and that is why India\\nhas been the slave of conquerors  for the last thousand years. Let us then join the wonderful\\nintellect of the Brahmins with  the heart, the noble  soul, the wonderful humanising power of\\nthe Great Master.\\nAddress at the Final Session\\n      27th September, 1893\\n      The World\\'s Parliament of Religions has become an accomplished fact, and the merciful\\nFather has helped those who la boured to bring it into existenc e, and crowned with success\\ntheir most unselfish labour. My  thanks to those noble souls w hose large hearts and love of\\ntruth first dreamed this wonderful dream and th en realised it. My thanks to the shower of\\nliberal sentiments that has overflowed this pl atform. My thanks to this enlightened audience\\nfor their uniform kindness to me and for thei r appreciation of ever y thought that tends to\\nsmooth the friction of  religion s. A few jarring notes were heard from time to time in this\\nharmony. My special thanks to them, for they have, by their striking c ontrast, made general\\nharmony the sweeter.\\n      Much has been said of the common gr ound of religious unity. I am not going just now to\\nventure my own theory. But if any one here hope s that this unity will come by the triumph of\\nany one of the religions and th e destruction of the other, to  him I say, \"Brother, yours is an\\nimpossible hope.\" Do I wish that the Christ ian would become Hindu? God forbid. Do I\\nwish that the Hindu or Buddhist would become Ch ristian? God forbid. The seed is put in the\\nground, and earth and air and water are placed ar ound it. Does the seed become the earth, or\\nthe air, or the water? No. It becomes a plant, it develops af ter the law of its own growth,\\nassimilates the air, the earth, and the water, converts them into plant substance, and grows\\ninto a plant.\\n      Similar is the case with religion. The Christian is not to beco me a Hindu or a Buddhist,\\nnor a Hindu or a Buddhist to beco me a Christian. But each  must assimilate the spirit of the\\nothers and yet preserve his  individuality and grow according to his own law of growth. If the\\nParliament of Religions has shown anything to th e world it is this: It has proved to the world\\nthat holiness, purity and charity are not the excl usive possessions of any church in the world,\\nand that every system has produced men and wo men of the most exalte d character. In the\\nface of  this evidence, if a nybody dreams of the exclusive surviv al of his own religion and the\\ndestruction of the others , I pity him from the bottom of my  heart, and point out to him that\\nupon the banner of every religion will soon be written, in spite  of resistance: \"Help and not\\nFight,\" \"Assimilation and not Destruction,\"  \"Harmony and Peace and not  Dissension.\"'"
